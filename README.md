Python Interface for  HTPOW (Cheap Chinese CNC Laser Engravers)

Right now, I'm still prototyping and writing this, the code will be cleaner in the near future.

**Hardware**
* The laser this is developed against is a cheap sub-$100 cnc 1000mw laser from China.
* The laser enclosure is unbranded
* It is listed as HW V2, Firmware V2.4
* The software it uses is HTOPW.
  * I am not a big fan of this software as it seems to only do raster stuff, and isn't the most user friendly, but it is functional.
  * It also goes by the name of SuperCarver (software and laser engraver)
* It looks identical to some cheap chinese NEJE Lasers, but the protocol seems to be different
* Mine came with a bad power supply and EU converter, so I just use a USB power cable and connect it to a 2.4amp power source or powerbank (not very stable, as it seems to go into standby mode with the power bank)

**How to Sniff traffic**
I used a freeware Serial Port Debugger called [SUDT AccessPort](http://www.sudt.com/en/ap/index.html), and would set it to listen to traffic on the com port of the laser, run a task, and save the output.  I would then sanitize the output using some regular expression replaces and look for patterns and trends in the data. A [parser](https://github.com/AppliedEllipsis/pyLaser/blob/master/parseAccessPort.py) was written to process and analyze the dumps easier.

#####WARNING
* I thought I screwed up my device when playing with the raster images, it was just I sent some cmds that changed speed to 0 and write speed to 99+

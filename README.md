Python Interface for  HTPOW (Cheap Chinese CNC Laser Engravers)

**Hardware**
* The laser this is developed against is a cheap sub-100 cnc 1000mw laser from China.
 * The laser enclosure is unbranded
 * It is listed as HW V2, Firmware V2.4
 * The software it uses is HTOPW.
 * It also goes by the name of SuperCarver
 * It looks identical to some cheap chinese NEJE Lasers, but the protocol seems to be different
 * Mine came with a bad power supply and EU converter, so I just use a USB power cable and connect it to a 2.4amp power source or powerbank (not very stable, as it seems to go into standby mode with the power bank)
